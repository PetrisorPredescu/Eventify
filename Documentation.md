# Introduction

**Eventify** is a dynamic web application that is built using the latest technologies including React, Vite, CSS and Firebase.This technical report provides an in-depth analysis of Eventify, a React application designed for booking events, with a particular focus on students. Eventify offers a comprehensive set of features, including indoor, outdoor, and online event information shared collaboratively with teams. This report will discuss the various React components, routers, and the integration of Firebase sign-in functionality within the application. The purpose of this project is to provide an efficient and reliable solution to university students who are looking for events to spend time with and to meet new students.

Student life comes with many good and bad things. In the era of speed and technology, students are more and more attracted to intrapersonal activities, therefore they face some common challenges that can affect their daily life. Among the prevailing problems that can influence these factors we can list: academic pressure that can lead to stress and anxiety; cultural and diversity issues where discrimination and language barriers make students face unique challenges; financial constraints that, due to living expenses and rising tuition costs, can affect students' education; the uncertainty of the future, which due to competitiveness and future prospects, students can be emotionally affected and often leads to anxiety.

In essence, Eventify stands as a testament to digital innovation in the realm of student event management. It combines the power of modern technology with an understanding of student needs, resulting in an application that redefines convenience, enhances participation, and promotes a vibrant student community. The era of traditional, labor-intensive event management is behind us. With Eventify, the future of student events is here, and it's digital.

# Methodology

The Agile methodology has been chosen as the framework for the development process of Eventify, the single-page web application for Solent University students. Agile is particularly well-suited for small-scale projects with changing requirements, as it emphasizes adaptability, frequent iterations, and ongoing user feedback.

Design Thinking offers an organised and methodical framework for comprehending, defining, brainstorming, prototyping, and refining the functionality and design of the Eventify app.
Eventify can benefit from design thinking for a number of reasons. First of all, the main goal of design thinking is to comprehend the wants, inclinations, and problems of the usersâ€”in this case, the students.
Eventify wants to develop an app that not only satisfies the functional requirements but also takes into account the users' emotional needs and aspirations by adhering to the design thinking principles. The process encourages a thorough comprehension of the target audience and their environment, facilitating the creation of an insightful and worthwhile solution.

| User Story for Eventify| Agile Iterations for Eventify|

|List of upcoming events, to decide which ones I might want to attend. |Build a feature that allows students to filter events by category. |
|Filter events by category, to find events that match my interests.| Develop a notification system for reminding students about their RSVP'd events.|
|RSVP to events, so the event organizers know I plan to attend.| Implement a feature that allows students to create and host their own events. |
|Receive notifications about events I've RSVP'd to, to not forget about them.| Build a system for students to leave feedback or rate events they've attended. |
|Personal event calendar, to keep track of events I'm interested in or plan to attend.| Admin-Develop a feature to add and remove events from the personal calendar.|
|Leave feedback or rate events I've attended, to share my experience with others.| Develop a feature to display popular or highly-rated events.|

# Methods

Evaluation is a critical step in the development process to ensure that the implemented solution effectively addresses the needs of its intended user base. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of Eventify, the following methods will be used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data.

**User Testing**: Direct user interaction with the application will be arranged in controlled conditions. Observing users while they navigate the app, their decision-making process, their interactions with various features, and their overall experience will provide rich data on the application's usability, design, and functionality.

**Online Surveys**: Surveys will be used to gather quantitative feedback from a larger pool of users. They will be designed to assess the application's performance, user-friendliness, and efficiency. Surveys will include structured questions to obtain precise, easy-to-analyze data, as well as some open-ended questions to capture additional comments and suggestions.

**In-depth Interviews**: This qualitative method will provide more detailed and nuanced insights into the user experience. Personal interviews with selected users will enable an understanding of their perspective in greater depth, including their likes, dislikes, and potential improvements they would like to see in Eventify.

**Focus Groups**: Group discussions will be arranged with small groups of users. The group setting can generate a diverse range of opinions and stimulate discussion, leading to deeper insights. It will help us understand how users perceive Eventify within a social context and elicit collective user feedback.

**Usage Statistics Analysis**: Analyzing in-app usage data provides insight into user behavior within the application. It provides objective, hard data on elements like the most used features, time spent on the app, event participation rate, user engagement, and more.

These methods are chosen to complement each other and provide a comprehensive evaluation. User testing, in-depth interviews, and focus groups provide qualitative insights into the user experience and potential improvements, while online surveys and usage statistics offer broader, quantitative data on user behavior and app performance.

The data collected will respect user privacy and confidentiality, ensuring that all information is anonymized and used solely for the purpose of improving the application. By utilizing this comprehensive, mixed-methods approach, we can ensure that Eventify is effectively serving its intended user base and continually improving based on user feedback.

# Conclusion

The primary goal of developing Eventify was to support Solent University students in their day-to-day lives by providing a convenient platform for discovering, participating in, and organizing events. The development journey, guided by the Agile methodology, encompassed several iterations, each adding distinct functionality to the application and shaping Eventify according to user needs and feedback.

User stories served as a foundational blueprint for the application development, ensuring that Eventify was designed with a user-centric approach. Through the Agile iterations, features like event discovery, RSVP, event creation, user feedback, and a personal event calendar were implemented.

Upon launching a prototype, a mixed-methods approach was employed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data for the evaluation of Eventify. Direct user testing, online surveys, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and usage statistics analysis were instrumental in providing a comprehensive picture of the user experience and the application's performance.

The feedback gathered from users revealed that Eventify was well-received and fulfilled a genuine need among the student community. The event discovery and personal calendar functionalities were particularly applauded for their convenience and user-friendly design. However, the evaluation also pointed out areas for improvement, such as enhancing the notification system and providing more filtering options for event discovery.

Reflecting on the development process, the Agile methodology proved beneficial in managing this small-scale individual project. Its emphasis on flexibility, user feedback, and iterative development facilitated the timely identification and resolution of issues, enabling steady progress towards the final solution.

In conclusion, Eventify has made significant strides in providing a responsive single-page web-application that supports Solent University students in managing their event participation and organization. There remain opportunities for improvement and expansion, guided by user feedback. The iterative nature of Agile ensures that the application will continue to evolve with the changing needs of its users, staying true to its purpose of enriching student life.
